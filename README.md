============

A game engine I built for fun in Python. It's built on the pygame framework (see www.pygame.org).
It's not documented too well, but if you look at the code for snake.py and tetris.py you might be able to figure out how to make things work. (sorry)

This is still a work in progress.

Snake:

To run, execute this in the command line:
$ ./snake.py

Tetris:
-------
![screenshot of tetris game](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/pygame-maker/master/screenshots/tetris.png "Wow such tetris")

To run, execute this in the command line:
$ ./tetris.py
