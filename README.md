pygame-maker
============

A game engine I built for fun in Python. It's built on the pygame framework (see www.pygame.org). You'll need to install pygame in order to run this.
The code has some basic documentation, and if you look at the code for snake.py and tetris.py you might be able to figure out how to make things work.

This is still a work in progress.

Example games:
=============

Snake:
-------
![screenshot of snake game](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/pygame-maker/master/screenshots/snake.png "Wow such snake")

To run, execute this in the command line:

$ ./snake.py

*Controls*: arrow keys or WASD to move. Escape to quit.

Tetris:
-------
![screenshot of tetris game](https://raw.github.com/ahuff44/pygame-maker/master/screenshots/tetris.png "Much tetris")

To run, execute this in the command line:

$ ./tetris.py

*Controls*: arrow keys to move the current piece, A and D to rotate it, and S to insta-drop the piece. Escape to quit.
